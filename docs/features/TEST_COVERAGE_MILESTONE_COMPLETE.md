## Test Coverage Analysis Results
Based on coverage.xml analysis:
- **Overall Coverage**: 39.4% (6,729 of 17,092 lines)
- **Target Coverage**: 80% (13,674 lines)
- **Lines to Cover**: 6,945 additional lines

### Module Breakdown
- `src/ml/`: 0% coverage (0/1,234 lines)
- `src/api/routes/`: 37.7% coverage (1,588/4,208 lines)
- `src/database/`: 21.8% coverage (567/2,598 lines)
- `src/api/graph/`: 2.8% coverage (45/1,607 lines)
- `src/scraper/extensions/`: 0% coverage (0/892 lines)

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Focus on ML Module and Scraper Extensions (0% coverage)
2. **Phase 2**: Improve Graph API and Database Layer
3. **Phase 3**: Enhance API Routes coverage
4. **Phase 4**: Add integration and performance tests
5. **Phase 5**: Establish automated testing infrastructure

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Achieve 80%+ coverage across all modules
- [ ] Implement comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Add integration testing suite
- [ ] Establish performance testing
- [ ] Automate test execution in CI/CD
- [ ] Maintain test quality standards

## Next Steps
The milestone and issue hierarchy are now complete. Development teams can:
1. Pick up any of the 20 issues
2. Follow the detailed task lists in each issue
3. Track progress through the milestone view
4. Use parent-child relationships for coordination

All issues are properly labeled, assigned, and linked to the milestone for effective project management.
