# Issue #18 Implementation Summary: Scraper Monitoring & Error Handling

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**Issue Requirements Met:**
- ‚úÖ Log scraper execution success/failure rates to CloudWatch
- ‚úÖ Implement retry logic for failed requests
- ‚úÖ Store failed URLs in DynamoDB for reattempts  
- ‚úÖ Send SNS alerts when scrapers fail multiple times

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Implemented

### Core Components Created:

1. **CloudWatchLogger** (`src/scraper/cloudwatch_logger.py`)
   - Real-time metrics logging to AWS CloudWatch
   - Batch processing for efficiency (20 metrics per batch)
   - Custom alarms for monitoring thresholds
   - Metrics: success rates, response times, articles scraped, retry counts, CAPTCHA encounters, IP blocks

2. **DynamoDBFailureManager** (`src/scraper/dynamodb_failure_manager.py`) 
   - Persistent failure tracking across scraper restarts
   - Intelligent retry scheduling with exponential backoff
   - Automatic cleanup of old failure records
   - Multiple retry strategies (exponential, linear, fixed interval)
   - Permanent failure detection to avoid infinite retries

3. **SNSAlertManager** (`src/scraper/sns_alert_manager.py`)
   - Multi-level alerting (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
   - Rate limiting to prevent alert spam (max 10 alerts per 5-minute window)
   - Structured alert messages with comprehensive metadata
   - Alert types: scraper failure, high failure rate, CAPTCHA blocking, IP blocking, performance degradation

4. **EnhancedRetryManager** (`src/scraper/enhanced_retry_manager.py`)
   - Circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures
   - Integration with all monitoring components
   - Context-aware retry decisions based on failure types
   - Configurable retry strategies with jitter to prevent thundering herd

### Integration Points:

5. **AsyncNewsScraperEngine** (Enhanced)
   - Optional monitoring initialization in constructor
   - Graceful degradation when monitoring unavailable
   - Backward compatibility maintained
   - Clean resource management in start/close methods

## üìä Monitoring Capabilities

### Metrics Tracked:
- **Performance**: Success rates, response times, throughput
- **Reliability**: Retry counts, failure patterns, circuit breaker states
- **Anti-Detection**: CAPTCHA encounters, IP blocks, user agent effectiveness
- **System Health**: Resource utilization, error rates, alert frequency

### Alert Types:
- **Scraper Failure**: Individual URL failures with retry context
- **High Failure Rate**: Success rate below configurable threshold
- **CAPTCHA Blocking**: Frequent CAPTCHA detection indicating anti-bot measures
- **IP Blocking**: Multiple IP addresses blocked by target sites
- **Performance Degradation**: Response times exceeding thresholds
- **System Errors**: Internal component failures and resource exhaustion

## üîß Configuration & Deployment

### Configuration File: `src/scraper/config_monitoring.json`
```json
{
  "monitoring": {
    "enabled": true,
    "cloudwatch": {
      "region_name": "us-east-1",
      "namespace": "NeuroNews/Scraper",
      "log_group": "/aws/lambda/neuronews-scraper"
    },
    "dynamodb": {
      "table_name": "neuronews-failed-urls",
      "retry_strategy": "exponential_backoff",
      "max_retries": 5
    },
    "sns": {
      "topic_arn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:ACCOUNT:neuronews-alerts"
    }
  }
}
```

### AWS Resources Required:
- **CloudWatch**: Log groups, custom metrics, alarms
- **DynamoDB**: Table `neuronews-failed-urls` with GSI for retry scheduling

    cloudwatch_namespace='NeuroNews/Scraper',
    dynamodb_table='neuronews-failed-urls',
    sns_topic_arn='arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:ACCOUNT:neuronews-alerts'

retry_manager = EnhancedRetryManager(
    cloudwatch_logger=cloudwatch,
    failure_manager=failure_manager,
