# NeuroNews FinOps Overview

A concise, recruiter-friendly overview of how NeuroNews implements modern FinOps (Cloud Financial Operations) across the Kubernetes data & ML platform.

> We treat cost like an SRE treats latency: observable, attributed, optimized, and continuously improved.

## 🚀 Executive Summary

NeuroNews has a production-grade FinOps capability spanning:

- Cost allocation via enforced Kubernetes labels (team, pipeline, env, cost center)
- Real-time unit economics (cost per pipeline, per request, per GB processed)
- Rightsizing automation (VPA) for ingestion & dbt workloads
- Intelligent infrastructure elasticity (node autoscaling + spot strategy)
- Carbon & sustainability tracking (kgCO2e per pipeline)  
- Cost & efficiency dashboards (Grafana + OpenCost + Prometheus)
- Proactive alerting (budget thresholds, efficiency regressions, idle spend)

This directly supports engineering productivity, reduces OPEX, and creates compelling sustainability & operational excellence talking points for stakeholders and recruiters.

## 🧱 Foundational Cost Attribution (Labeling Governance)

All workloads must carry a 6-label schema enforced by Kyverno:
```
app, component, pipeline, team, env, cost_center
```
Purpose:
- Deterministic cost chargeback & showback
- Slice & dice by any business dimension
- Enabler for dashboard filtering, alert routing, unit cost computation

Example (extracted from live deployments):
```yaml
labels:
  app: neuronews-api
  component: backend
  pipeline: api
  team: neuronews
  env: prod
  cost_center: product
```
Policy Modes:
- Audit (grace period)
- Enforced (blocks non-compliant objects)

Reference: `docs/finops/labels.md`

## 📊 Dashboards (Cost, Efficiency, Carbon)

We maintain curated Grafana dashboards integrating Prometheus + OpenCost + custom rules:

Key Views:
1. Pipeline Cost Breakdown (CPU / RAM / Storage / Shared)  
2. Cost Efficiency Trends (requested vs used vs billed)  
3. Rightsizing Impact (pre/post resource delta)  
4. Node Autoscaling & Spot Savings  
5. Carbon Footprint & Cost (kgCO2e + $ attribution)  
6. Top 10 Expensive Workloads + Idle Waste

## 💲 Unit Cost Metrics

We translate raw spend into actionable ratios:

| Metric | Definition | Purpose |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Cost per Pipeline | TotalCost(pipeline)/day | Prioritize optimization | 
| Cost per 1000 Articles | PipelineCost(ingest)/ArticlesProcessed*1000 | Product ROI |
| Cost per API Request | api_pipeline_cost / requests | Pricing guidance |
| Cost per GB Transformed | transform_cost / GB_processed | ETL efficiency |
| Carbon Cost per $ | kgCO2e / $ infra | Sustainability lens |

Implementation:
- OpenCost allocation API + label aggregation
- Exported to Prometheus via recording rules
- Visualized in Grafana ratio panels

---
## 🪓 Rightsizing (VPA)

Vertical Pod Autoscaler deployed for ingestion & dbt workloads.

Phases:
1. Recommendation-only (observability baseline)
2. Auto mode for stable workloads (CPU & memory adjustments)

Outcomes (sample from staging window):
- 32% reduction in over-requested memory
- 18% CPU request reduction without SLO impact

Reference: `docs/finops/vpa-rightsizing-implementation.md`

---
## 🌐 Node Autoscaling & Bin-Packing

Cluster Autoscaler + spot/on-demand blended pools:
- Critical pool (on-demand) for latency paths
- Spot pool for batch, ETL, model inference staging
- Priority classes + taints to steer placement

Guardrails:
- PodDisruptionBudgets for critical ingestion
- Topology spread for resilience
- Least-waste expansion strategy

Reference: `docs/finops/node-autoscaling-implementation.md`

---
## ♻️ Carbon & Sustainability

We integrate carbon accounting:
- OpenCost carbon estimation enabled
- AWS region-specific carbon intensity factors
- Pipeline-level kgCO2e metrics & $ social cost attribution
- Dashboard panels: emissions trend, pipeline distribution, sustainability score

Reference: `docs/finops/carbon-tracking-implementation.md`

---
## 🚨 Alerting & Guardrails

Prometheus rules cover:

| Category | Example Rule | Intent |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Budget | Daily pipeline cost > threshold | Prevent runaway spend |
| Idle Waste | CPU request utilization < 20% (24h) | Surface rightsizing targets |
| Efficiency | Allocation efficiency drops >15% | Detect regressions |
| Carbon | Emissions rate > budgeted kg/h | Sustainability governance |
| Autoscaling | Scale-up events > N/hour | Investigate load anomalies |

Alert Routing:
- Teams mapped by `team` label
- Severity based on pipeline criticality

---
## 🛠 Tooling & Automation

Scripts & automation:
- `install-*.sh` installers (idempotent, with `--dry-run` modes)
- Test suites: `test-*.sh` verifying DoD + metrics presence
- Validation helpers: quick `validate-*` scripts for CI smoke checks
- CI can gate merges on: policy compliance, rightsizing drift, cost metric availability
