# Security Best Practices

## Infrastructure Security

### IAM Roles & Policies
- Follow least privilege principle for all service roles
- Use condition statements to restrict access by IP and AWS region
- Enable MFA for role assumption
- Avoid using wildcard (*) permissions
- Use resource-based policies where possible
- Regular rotation of access keys and credentials

### Network Security
- All services deployed in private subnets
- Use VPC endpoints for AWS services
- Restrict security group ingress/egress rules
- Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring
- Use AWS Network Firewall for additional protection

### Data Security
- Enable encryption at rest for all storage services
- Use AWS KMS for key management
- Enable encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- Implement proper data retention and deletion policies
- Regular backup verification and testing

## Monitoring & Auditing

### CloudTrail
- Enable CloudTrail in all regions
- Enable log file validation
- Configure CloudWatch alerts for suspicious activities
- Retain logs for at least 365 days
- Enable multi-region trail

### CloudWatch
- Configure metric filters for security events
- Set up alerts for:
  - IAM policy changes
  - Security group modifications
  - Network ACL changes
  - Root account usage
  - Failed login attempts

### Access Logging
- Enable access logging for S3 buckets
- Configure API Gateway access logs
- Enable Neptune audit logs
- Monitor Redshift query patterns

## Service-Specific Security

### Redshift
- Deploy in private subnet only
- Enable encryption at rest
- Use IAM authentication
- Regular security patches and updates
- Monitor user activity and query patterns

### Neptune
- Enable encryption at rest
- Use IAM authentication
- Regular security patches
- Monitor graph query patterns
- Audit sensitive data access

### Lambda Functions
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper error handling
- Regular dependency updates
- Monitor function permissions
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for secrets

### API Gateway
- Enable WAF for API protection
- Use API keys and usage plans
- Enable request validation
- Configure throttling and quotas
- Monitor for unusual traffic patterns

## Compliance & Governance

### Access Control
- Regular access reviews
- Use AWS Organizations for account management
- Implement proper RBAC
- Document all access changes
- Regular permission audits

### Change Management
- Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Code review requirements
- Change approval process
- Version control for all changes
- Regular security testing

### Incident Response
- Documented incident response plan
- Regular security drills
- Automated remediation where possible
- Clear escalation paths
- Post-incident reviews

## Development Security

### Code Security
- Regular dependency scanning
- Static code analysis
- Container image scanning
- Secret detection in code
- Regular security testing

### CI/CD Security
- Secure build processes
- Artifact signing
- Pipeline security controls
- Regular security scans
- Access control for deployments

## Regular Maintenance

### Updates & Patches
- Regular security patches
- Dependency updates
- OS updates for EC2 instances
- Database version updates
- Regular security assessments

### Monitoring & Reviews
- Regular security audits
- Compliance checks
- Access reviews
- Security metrics review
- Incident response testing
