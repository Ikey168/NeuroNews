                Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook announced the company's latest breakthrough in artificial intelligence 
                during the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in Cupertino, California. The new M3 Neural 
                chip features advanced machine learning capabilities powered by a custom neural processing unit.
                
                "This represents a quantum leap in our AI capabilities," said Cook during the keynote presentation.
                The chip will power Apple's new Siri 2.0 voice assistant and enhance the company's Privacy 
                Protection Policy. Apple's Senior Vice President of Hardware Technologies, Johny Srouji, 
                demonstrated the chip's performance improvements in real-time language translation and 
                computer vision tasks.
                
                The announcement sent Apple's stock price soaring on NASDAQ, with analysts from Goldman Sachs 
                and Morgan Stanley praising the innovation. The chip will be manufactured using TSMC's 
                3-nanometer process and will debut in the upcoming iPhone 16 and MacBook Pro models.

                The European Union has passed the comprehensive Artificial Intelligence Act, marking the 
                world's first major regulation of AI systems. The legislation was approved by the European 
                Parliament in Brussels after months of negotiations between member states.
                
                European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed the act as "a global first that 
                will set the standard for AI governance worldwide." The regulation introduces strict 
                requirements for high-risk AI applications in healthcare, finance, and law enforcement.
                
                Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta will need to comply with new transparency 
                requirements for their large language models. The act also establishes the European AI 
                Office in Dublin, Ireland, to oversee implementation and enforcement.
                
                Privacy advocates, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Privacy International, 
                welcomed the legislation's focus on protecting citizens' rights. However, some tech industry 
                groups expressed concerns about compliance costs and innovation impacts.
                
                The regulation will be phased in over the next two years, with penalties reaching up to 
                €35 million or 7% of global annual revenue for violations.

                Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have demonstrated a new 
                quantum error correction method that could bring practical quantum computing closer to 
                reality. The team, led by Professor Peter Shor and Dr. Sarah Chen, published their 
                findings in the journal Nature Quantum Information.
                
                The breakthrough was achieved using IBM's 127-qubit quantum processor at the MIT-IBM 
                Watson AI Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The research was funded by the National 
                Science Foundation (NSF) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).
                
                "This represents a major step toward fault-tolerant quantum computing," said Shor, 
                who is also known for developing Shor's algorithm for quantum factorization. The team's 
                approach reduces quantum error rates by 90% compared to previous methods.
                
                The research has implications for cryptography, drug discovery, and climate modeling. 
                Companies like Rigetti Computing, IonQ, and Atom Computing are already exploring 
                commercial applications of the technology.
                
                The work builds on earlier research from Google's Quantum AI team and the University 
                of California, Berkeley. The next phase will involve scaling the approach to larger 
                quantum systems with support from the Department of Energy.
