## 🔍 **Testing Scenarios Covered**

### Redshift Disaster Recovery

1. **Failure Simulation**: Security group access blocking

2. **Snapshot Discovery**: Latest automated snapshot identification

3. **Cluster Restore**: Snapshot-based cluster restoration

4. **Connectivity Testing**: Connection validation and performance checks

5. **Cleanup**: Resource cleanup and access restoration

### Neptune Failover Testing

1. **Replica Discovery**: Read replica endpoint identification

2. **Connectivity Testing**: Primary and replica connection validation

3. **Query Performance**: Read query execution and performance comparison

4. **Endpoint Switching**: Configuration updates for failover

5. **Rollback**: Original configuration restoration
