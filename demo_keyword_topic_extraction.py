"""
Demo script for Keyword Extraction and Topic Modeling (Issue #29).

This script demonstrates the complete functionality of the keyword extraction
and topic modeling system, including:
- Processing sample articles
- Extracting keywords using TF-IDF
- Identifying topics using LDA
- Storing results in database
- Querying topic-based search API

Run this script to validate the implementation and see sample results.
