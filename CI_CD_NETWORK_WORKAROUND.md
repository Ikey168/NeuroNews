# CI/CD Network Connectivity Workaround

## Issue Analysis
The CI/CD environment is experiencing network connectivity issues preventing pip from reaching PyPI:
```
[Errno 101] Network is unreachable
HTTPSConnectionPool(host='files.pythonhosted.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded
```

## Current Environment Status ✅
- **pip**: 25.1.1 (latest: 25.2) - ✅ Sufficient
- **setuptools**: 80.9.0 - ✅ Recent version  
- **wheel**: Not installed - ⚠️ May not be critical
- **Core dependencies**: ✅ All available (pytest, numpy, psycopg2)

## Solution: Skip Upgrade Step

Since our current environment has sufficient package versions and all core functionality works, we can safely skip the pip upgrade step.

### Recommended CI/CD Configuration

Replace:
```yaml
- name: Upgrade pip
  run: python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools
```

With:
```yaml
- name: Check pip and verify dependencies
  run: |
    echo "Current pip version: $(pip --version)"
    echo "Current setuptools version: $(python -c 'import setuptools; print(setuptools.__version__)')"
    echo "Testing core dependencies..."
    python -c "import pytest, numpy, psycopg2; print('✅ All core dependencies available')"
    echo "Skipping pip upgrade due to network restrictions"
```

Or with error handling:
```yaml
- name: Upgrade pip (with fallback)
  run: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools || {
      echo "⚠️ Pip upgrade failed (network issue), checking current versions..."
      echo "Current pip: $(pip --version)"
      echo "Current setuptools: $(python -c 'import setuptools; print(setuptools.__version__)' 2>/dev/null || echo 'not available')"
      echo "✅ Continuing with existing packages..."
    }
```

## Validation Results
✅ **Issue #31 implementation fully functional with current packages**
✅ **Database mocking approach works correctly**  
✅ **All core testing dependencies available**
✅ **No critical functionality impacted**

## Risk Assessment: LOW
- Current pip (25.1.1) vs latest (25.2): Minor version difference
- Current setuptools (80.9.0): Recent and sufficient
- Missing wheel: Not critical for our use case
- All tests pass with current environment

## Recommendation
**Proceed with testing using current package versions.** The pip upgrade step can be made optional or skipped entirely without impacting functionality.
