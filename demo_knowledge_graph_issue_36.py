Demo: Enhanced Knowledge Graph Population - Issue #36

This demo showcases the complete implementation of Issue #36 requirements:
1. Extract Named Entities (People, Organizations, Technologies, Policies)
2. Store relationships in AWS Neptune
3. Implement Graph Builder enhancements
4. Verify entity linking with SPARQL/Gremlin queries

The demo includes realistic news articles and demonstrates the full pipeline
from NLP processing to knowledge graph population and querying.

        Microsoft Corporation announced today an expanded partnership with OpenAI to advance
        artificial intelligence research and development. The collaboration, led by CEO Satya
        Nadella of Microsoft and CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI, will focus on developing next-generation
        AI models and improving Azure cloud infrastructure for AI workloads.
        
        The partnership includes a $10 billion investment from Microsoft into OpenAI's research
        initiatives. The two companies will work together on GPT-4 improvements, multimodal AI
        systems, and enterprise AI solutions. Azure OpenAI Service will be enhanced to provide
        better access to advanced language models for business customers.
        
        "This partnership represents the future of AI innovation," said Satya Nadella during
        the announcement at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The collaboration
        aims to ensure responsible AI development while maintaining competitive advantages in
        the rapidly evolving technology landscape.
        
        The partnership also addresses regulatory concerns under the European Union's AI Act
        and ensures compliance with emerging AI governance frameworks. Both companies emphasized
        their commitment to AI safety and ethical development practices.

        Google LLC researchers have achieved a significant breakthrough in quantum computing,
        demonstrating quantum supremacy with their new Sycamore quantum processor. The team,
        led by Dr. John Preskill and Dr. Hartmut Neven, successfully performed calculations
        that would take classical computers thousands of years to complete.
        
        The quantum computer, housed at Google's quantum AI laboratory in Santa Barbara,
        California, uses 70 superconducting qubits to solve complex optimization problems.
        This advancement brings practical quantum computing applications closer to reality,
        particularly in cryptography, drug discovery, and financial modeling.
        
        "We are entering a new era of computational capability," stated Sundar Pichai, CEO
        of Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company. The breakthrough has implications for
        cybersecurity standards and may require updates to current encryption protocols
        under various data protection regulations.
        
        IBM Corporation and Amazon Web Services have announced competing quantum initiatives,
        indicating intense competition in the quantum computing space. The race to achieve
        practical quantum advantage continues to drive innovation across the technology sector.
        
        Regulatory bodies are closely monitoring quantum computing developments due to potential
        impacts on national security and data privacy under frameworks like GDPR and CCPA.

        Tesla Inc. and Panasonic Corporation have announced the expansion of their joint
        venture to increase lithium-ion battery production capacity. The partnership, overseen
        by Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, and Kazuhiro Tsuga, CEO of Panasonic, will establish
        new Gigafactory facilities in Texas and Nevada.
        
        The expansion aims to meet growing demand for electric vehicles and energy storage
        systems. Tesla's Gigafactory in Austin, Texas, will be retrofitted with Panasonic's
        latest 4680 battery cell technology, increasing production efficiency by 40%.
        
        "This collaboration strengthens our position in the sustainable energy transition,"
        said Elon Musk during a press conference at Tesla's headquarters in Palo Alto,
        California. The partnership leverages Panasonic's expertise in battery chemistry
        and Tesla's innovative manufacturing processes.
        
        The expansion requires compliance with environmental regulations and safety standards
        set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Energy (DOE).
        Battery recycling programs will be implemented to address lifecycle environmental
        impacts under the Circular Economy Action Plan.
        
        Competition in the EV battery market includes partnerships between Ford and SK Innovation,
